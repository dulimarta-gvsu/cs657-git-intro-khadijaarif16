### What I've learnt
I've learnt to differentiate between ***Git*** and ***GitHub*** and have understood how the two work together to create an efficient version control system.

### What I'm still confused about
While I understand what features git has to offer, I do need to explore them to get familarized with them. I'm especially interested in merging code when multiple developers are working on the same repository.
