### Hi, I'm Khadija! 😊
I've worked as a Data Engineer for a bit and am currently pursuing my master's in Human Centered Computing. 

### What I hope to learn 🧠
I've been out of touch with development since I was pursuing a different career so I am looking forward to refreshing my existing skills. And I also want to be updated on how much the industry has changed and what technologies are being used. 

### Hobbies ✨
I enjoy photography and have been trying to acquire better embroidery skills. I also love watching anime.
